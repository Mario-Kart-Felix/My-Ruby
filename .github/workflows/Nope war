Create a package.json for your project (see required contents or use npm init)
Commit it along your project files, this will be your dependency tracking
npm install will sort out and download all dependencies
Deploying:

Upload/push your files to the server
Either send the node_modules folder along or run npm install on the server
To use your private libraries you'll need to either upload the modules folder or publish them (see below)
Private/local libraries:

Create the library anywhere you want (e.g. ~/Projects/mylib)
go to the mylib folder and run npm link
go to the project's folder and run npm install mylib
Now your local library is symlinked into your project's node_modules
