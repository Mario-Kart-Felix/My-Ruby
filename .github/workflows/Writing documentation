This project uses ReadTheDocs to build and serve the documentation.

If you want to run the generation of documentation (recommended!), you need to have Python installed. Then install sphinx $ pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild

Assuming you have Python already, install Sphinx:

$ pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild
Go to the docs directory and build the html documentation:

$ cd docs
$ make html
Just open then target/html/index.html page in your browser.

Hint

You can hot reload your changes by using sphinx-autobuild:

$ sphinx-autobuild source target/html
Then just edit the documentation and look for your changes at http://127.0.0.1:8000

To learn more about the reStructuredText format, please look at the basic guide.
